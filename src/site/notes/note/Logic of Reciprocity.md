An ontology ([[Dynamic Differentiated-Holism\|Dynamic Differentiated-Holism]]) and logic of reciprocity is advanced as the basic theoretical framework in understanding natural reality. Originating first with the Taoist '*Yin-Yang*' view that [[Existence Exists\|existence]] is a set of _complementary_ opposites[^1] (much like the north and south poles of earth or a magnet), the idea of reciprocity treats all basic ontological distinctions as interdependent, mutually supportive realities.

"Reciprocity" means distinguishible yet mutually supportive realities, viz., [[Existence Exists\|existence exists]] as a *co-realization* of [[Fact\|facts]]. **Instead of an either/or logic, reciprocity argues for a both/and logic of existence, subsuming an either/or logic**. One that requires the consistent application of a [[Generalized Complementarity Principle\|generalized principle of complementarity]]. 

Reciprocity rejects and subsumes all forms of [[Dualism Versus Duality\|dualism]]; that is, the classic [[Philosophy\|philosophical]] dichotomies are actually all interdependencies. Reality is both a one/whole and a many/plurality; reality is both stability (being) and change (becoming and passing away); reality necessarily contains both order and chaos (to use Toaist terms), which in effect depend upon each other. [[note/Entities and Properties (BPC)\|Entities]] are [[Impredicativity\|defined through their relationships]] with other [[Nested Natural Units\|nested natural units]]. Reciprocal interdependencies operate across multinested scales of existence. And—[[Organism-Environment System\|ecological reciprocity]], entails that the organism and the environment are open and interpenetrating [[Systems Theory\|systems]] and form an interdependent unity. Within a framework of ecological reciprocity, there is no absolute boundary between the organism and the environment, and neither can be defined independently of the other. [[Consciousness\|Consciousness]], [[Knowledge\|knowledge]], [[Organismic Self\|the self]], [[perception-action coupling\|behavior]], etc. are all ecological realities *co-realized* in [[Facts of the Environment to Be Perceived\|a supporting environment]]. 

Gibson’s [[note/Ecological Approach\|ecological approach]] to psychology is anti-dualistic—neither mind and matter, conscious subject and world, are ontologically seperate realities. In Gibsonian psychology, there is a reciprocal connection between self-awareness and other-awareness, a reciprocal connection between awareness of persistence and change, and a reciprocal or interdependent awareness of the spatial arrangement of objects, including the perceiver’s body, and the temporal arrangement of events in the world, including the perceiver’s life.

A central tenet of [[Dynamic Differentiated-Holism\|this logic's complentary ontology]] is that reality or existence is fundamentally evolutionary (*crucially this is not to be conflated with a teleological or "creator-driven," theistic view of the universe---"evolutionary" simply means that it's*:), characterized by processes that are non-linear, adaptive, and far-from-equilibrium. Drawing from principles of [[Nonlinear Thermodynamics\|nonlinear thermodynamics]] and [[Homeokinetics\|homeokinetics]] (and related or derivative fields), existence is understood as inherently dynamical, cyclic ([[Conformal Cyclic Cosmology\|conformal cyclic cosmology]]), even, where every process of differentiation is continuous with integration. 

Rejecting [[Plato\|Plato’s]] elevation of eternity and the primordial as the "highest" level of reality, standing above time (where time, in essence, is a “fall from perfection”), the evolutionary model of reality sees time, order, complexity, freedom, uniqueness, life, consciousness, and other supposed “higher qualities" as processes that are all reciprocally coupled together and *co-evolving* in like fashion. All evolution is reciprocal evolution—things evolve together, (influencing the systemic conditions or [[Constraints and Degrees of Freedom\|constraints on the degrees of freedom]]) pushing or instigating each other along. Organisms and their environment evolve interactively and interdependently [[Partial vs. Total Systems\|as a total system.]] The theory of [[Global Evolution\|evolution as a global phenomenon]] articulates that the geological, chemical, and atmospheric components of the earth have co-evolved, interactively with the biosphere of life—serving as a prime example of differentiated-holistic reciprocal evolution; life moves the world as much as the world moves life.

**But**, before we get ahead of ourselves, we must understand further how these ideas have manifested throughout history. Aside from the ancient philosophy of Taoism, the basic idea of reciprocity derives all the way from [[Aristotelian Functionalism\|Aristotelian functionalism]] to the work of the open systems theoretical scientist [[Ilya Prigogine\|Ilya Prigogine]]. And many other notable influences. For an indepth history of the development of Gibson's concept of reciprocity and [[note/Ecological Approach\|his broader approach to science]]---see: *[The Reciprocity of Perceiver and Environment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZT0kejN-YJCkP-BUG8oBr5T2uJj3xeJ/view?usp=sharing)*---here, the foregoing will be summarized only in essentials:

[^1]: Not to be mistaken as ([[Fallacy of Reification of the Zero\|Fallacy of Reification of the Zero]]) advancing some sort of Hegelian dialectic. [[Non-Existence\|Non-Existence]] has no logical or otherwise relation to existence. Reciprocity does *not* consider this as an actual ontological distinction.
