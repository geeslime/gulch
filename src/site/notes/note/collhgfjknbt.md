# <i><h5><center>Ontological And Epistemological Foundations:</center></h5></i>

At its core, the ecological approach is grounded in two foundational and intertwined pillars which elevates its explanatory power well beyond just organism-environment dynamics:

1. *Ontological foundation*: At the heart of the **ecological approach** lies the [[Logic of Reciprocity\|logic of reciprocity]], which articulates an inherent [[Generalized Complementarity Principle\|complementarity]] found throughout nature. Reciprocity emphasizes that reality is fundamentally relational and [[Impredicativity\|impredicative]], characterized by mutual entailment across systems and scales, [[Fallacy of the Thing-in-Itself\|where no entity exists independently of its ongoing participation in multiply reciprocal relations]]. 
	
	Organisms and their environments, for instance, are not merely juxtaposed entities but co-define one another as distinguishable yet mutually supportive realities of a unified system. Reciprocity is most evident in the ecological interface, where both organism and environment each structure one another *in turn*; wherein neither the organism nor the environment can be understood in isolation, embodying *complementarity* rather than division. The term *environment* means a surrounding, thus the concept implies something surrounded; the environment is ontologically relative to the perceiver and there is no dichotomous sepration of mind and matter or perceiver and world. Neither the perceiver (or perception) nor the environment is understood atheoretically, for each pair of the reciprocity is selectively investigated and described involving concepts or assumptions regarding the other member of the pair. [[Affordances\|Affordances]], exemplifying this mutual structuring, are not inherent in objects or organisms alone but scale systemically, ([[takens' embedding theorem\|embedded]]) as those possibilities for interaction structured at the scale of their intersection and throughout their ongoing engagement—viz, as relational properties at the ecological scale of organism-environment reciprocity. They exist only as opportunities for action specific to an organism's capacities, and they shape, in turn, how the organism engages with its environment.[^1]
	
	Reciprocity permits us to move beyond the rigid separations and the reductive tendencies of dualism and monism. It necessitates a radical rethinking of ontology; what we can term "[[Dynamic Differentiated-Holism\|Dynamic Differentiated-Holism]]" (DDH): *a framework where parts and wholes are co-realized within a heterogeneous and seamlessly packed, interpenetrating web of nested natural units*[^2] (see F.note2 for a great concretization of this). One of Gibson’s strongest and unique contributions was a reconciliation of whole-part dualism, *without attempting to relegate to a derivative status either wholes or parts*. Reality is not composed of indivisible building blocks, isolated entities, or an abstract, undifferentiated whole that subsumes its parts; differentiation and holism are are inseparably intertwined. Any part is itself (a *relational whole*) inherently [[Simplicity-Complexity Reciprocity\|complex]] and possesses some activity peculiar to it ([[The Law of Causality\|law of causality]]). Any part itself has parts. There is no formless matter, no simple (unanalyzable) elements on which more complex entities are built (but only *[[Entity-Property Reciprocity\|propertied things]]*). The parts are necessary, but they are not identified with [[Causal Power of Entities\|the causal power or identity of a thing]]; rather, it is their *reciprocal alignments* (how [[Entity and Property (BPC)\|their properties]]---[[Constituent and Composite Entities (BPC)\|not parts]]---co-condition one another in [[Fallacy of the Linear Causal Chain Model\|a nonlinear fashion]]).  DDH not only rejects the elementarism of the [[Newtonian World View\|Newtonian world view]] but also its “inert” or passive view of [[Entity and Property (BPC)\|entities]]; entities are not “moved about” by external forces nor by each other because [[The Error of Mechanistic Causality\|there is no such thing as mechanistic causality]]. Ultimately, DDH completely rejects Newton’s ontology of discrete inert elements contained in absolute empty containers of "space" and "time," replacing it with [[Nested Natural Units\|nested natural units]] of a dynamic, [[Self-Organization\|self-organizing]] structure wherin reciprocity (distinguishible yet mutually supportive, *co-realizations*) is the essential nature of reality itself.
