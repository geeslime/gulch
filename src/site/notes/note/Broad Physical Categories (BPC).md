**Broad physical categories**[^1] are the most [[Fundamentality\|fundamental]], most abstract [[Concept\|concepts]] scientists use when [[Science\|investigating the natural world]].

<center><h1><i>Broad Physical Categories in Hierarchical Order:</i></h1></center>


> [!order] Principle of ordering:
>  Existents which condition the identity of a given existent will come before that existent and will show up in the definition of that existent. If two ideas are written side by side, it means they [[Logic of Reciprocity\|mutually condition]] one another.

[[Existence Exists\|Existent]] and [[Law of Identity\|Identity]] are defined *ostensively*, viz., they can only be gestured to. We simply point at something and say that's that. These two concepts cannot [[note/Rules of Definitions\|be defined]] any further because existent and identity are the broadest categories, they don't belong to any wider [[(Todo) rulesofdefinitionsss/(1) Rule of Genus and Differentia\|genus]]. These are the basis of everything else—everything else is an existent with identity.
