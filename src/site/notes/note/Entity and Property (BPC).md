| [[note/Broad Physical Categories (BPC)\|Broad Physical Categories (BPC)]] | Definition                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ***1.*** Entity                     | An existent having particular **properties**. |
| ***1.*** Property                   | An aspect of an **entity’s** identity.        |

Notice that [[Entity-Property Reciprocity\|these two categories mutually condition one another]]. Each term appears in the definition of the other, so they are put side by side in the list at the same level of the hierarchy. The standard way to think about **entity and property** is that because all properties are properties of entities, entities should come first. That sounds pretty straightforward and true(in the former) —all properties are properties of entities, so entity does condition property. But what *we validly designate as an entity is something which has particular properties,* so property also conditions entity.

Let's think about a door. A door is an entity. This is to say that it is *a distinctly propertied[^1] reality and acts as a unified whole [at the scale-relevant context of its causal efficaciousness]*. However, the knob, which is just part of the door, is *also an entity in its own right* since it also has certain properties and rotates as a whole. The knob is a part of the door’s [[(Todo) broadcategories/Constituent and Composite Entities (BPC)\|composition]], but composition is *not* equivalent to [[Law of Identity\|identity]]—composition is not a subsumtive relation as traditionally assumed but is a [[Logic of Reciprocity\|reciprocal]] one. In fact, parts are incidental to the *identity* of the whole, and the whole, vice versa, is incidental to the *identity* of its parts. **An entity's identity is its properties**—not its components. (The [[(Todo) broadcategories/Constituent and Composite Entities (BPC)\|reciprocity of parts and wholes]] is of a categorically distinct kind than [[Entity-Property Reciprocity\|the reciprocity of entities and their properties]]; but they are nonetheless both closely linked). 

Entities, in this framework, are concieved of as "[[Nested Natural Units\|nested natural units]]". A door is an entity not because of its hinges or planks or knob but because of its [[Structural-Functional Reciprocity\|structural-functional reciprocity]] with other nested natural units—viz., as a dynamical [[CES Model\|system]].

The apt question to entertain the identity-as-composition view is this: Is a house just what's inside the house? At first glance, it seems intuitive to consider a house as merely the sum of its enclosed spaces—the rooms, furniture, walls, floors, and ceilings. But such a view quickly unravels when we realize that the house depends on far more than these internal features *to function as a house*. Take, for instance, the wall spaces themselves. Are they "inside" the house? Between the drywall and exterior siding, there exist pipes, wires, insulation, and conduits that enable vital functions like water flow, heating, cooling, and electrical power. These components are integral to the house's function as a controlled habitat, yet they are not directly part of the "living space" that one might initially imagine when defining a house’s "inside." Further complicating this picture, these pipes and wires do not stop neatly at the house's exterior. They connect to external systems like municipal water mains, electrical grids, and communication networks. *The house’s functional identity depends on these external networks as much as on its internal components*. Without them, the house ceases to act as a modern shelter—it cannot light a room, flush a toilet, or maintain a livable temperature. 

The idea of limiting the house’s identity to its "inside" fails because what happens "inside" is inherently dependent on what is "outside." Even more troubling, the notion of "inside" becomes ambiguous. Does it include crawl spaces, attics, and basements? Are these part of the house’s "internal" composition? What about the foundation of the house—is it part of the house? A house does not float in the air; its foundation anchors it to the earth, distributing its weight and stabilizing it against winds or earthquakes. But a foundation cannot function without the soil, rock, or other geological structures it rests upon. Do we include the ground beneath as part of the house? If so, where do we draw the line? Does the house extend into the layers of the Earth that bear its foundation? What about the air inside, which flows and exchanges with the external atmosphere? If the house’s interior depends on external systems for ventilation or pressure equilibrium, is the surrounding air also part of the house? Crucially, we must ask, what "inside" refers to in this context? Does it include the garage, which often serves both as a functional part of the house and as a transitional space to the external world? Do we consider the driveway, which is essential for accessing the house? Or the yard, which is enclosed by fencing [that delineates property boundaries](https://liquidzulu.github.io/homesteading-and-property-rights/#the-criteria-for-property-borders) but is not "inside" in any traditional sense? These questions illustrate that the idea of *"inside" is itself a relational concept, dependent on context and perspective*.

You can see different things as entities depending on your perspective (that is, at certain [[Granularity\|grains of analyses]]). You can see the entire house as an entity and the door as just part of it. You can see the Earth as an entity going around the sun and the house as only part of that. *"So, can you just draw the lines anywhere you want and call anything an entity?"* No. What distinguishes an entity is that its properties define how it acts as a whole in relation to other nested natural units. When you're talking about the door you can't exclude the knob as a part since it moves along with the rest of the door. On the other hand, *you cannot designate the left side of the door and a layer of air one millimeter above the door as an entity* because that set of stuff has no particular properties that would qualify it as an entity. Such a grouping does not act as a whole in relation to other entities. It fails to exhibit any coherent [[(Todo) broadcategories/Relationship (BPC)\|relationship]] with other nested natural units. The left side of the door and a layer of air do not form a structural whole, cannot move or function together, and do not play any unified role in the house-as-habitat system. 

Properties are neither additive nor derivative. They are not something “added” to an entity’s identity, nor do they result from summing the characteristics or activities of its parts. Likewise [[Emergentism\|they do not “emerge”]] as some novel phenomenon from the [[Simplicity-Complexity Reciprocity\|complexity]] of interactions within or between parts. Such phrasing implies an ontological gap between an entity and its properties—such a gap does not exist. They are not external attributes or supplementary characteristics. Instead, an entity's identity is its properties, nothing more, nothing less. Properties are the _systematicity_ and _relationality_ of the entity itself. [[Impredicativity\|An entity is defined by what it is, not by what it is made of]]. This distinction is critical to avoiding the [[Reductionist Fallacies\|error of reductionism]], where parts are assumed to hold causal primacy. There is no "immutable core" or "ultimate units" that makes up reality. [[Generalized Complementarity Principle\|Any part itself has parts and when examined closely reveals further nested levels of relationships and complexity]]; any part is itself inherently complex and possesses some activity peculiar to it ([[Law of Causality\|law of causality]]). The [[Dynamic Invariance\|dynamic invariance]] of a relationship or set of relationships and their reciprocal alignment with other entities(as nested natural units), all manifest as the entity’s properties. These properties persist as long as the relations persist, but they also adapt dynamically to changes (see: [[Permanency-Change Reciprocity\|Permanency-Change Reciprocity]]) in the entity’s embedded context.[^2]

What we find in [[History of Science\|the history of science]] is that **it's helpful to be creative about what you consider to be an entity**:

[[Archimedes\|Archimedes]] identifies a very special entity, which is *"a piece of water that would have been there if a boat wasn't."* He's treating this piece of water as a separate entity, and *it is.* It's an entity that ends up being pushed up by the waters below it *with the same force that would have pushed up on the boat if the boat was there instead.* Since this body of water has a particular property, that property is just somewhat complex—it's being pushed up by the same waters that would have pushed up on the boat—it is valid for Archimedes to *identify* it as an entity. This perspective allowed Archimedes to think about the force that the surrounding waters exerted on a boat, which caused it to float.

Using this framework to address a famous example given by [[Heraclitus\|Heraclitus]] while rejecting the law of identity (see: [[A River as an Entity\|A River as an Entity]]) is fairly instructive. In summary of the foregoing: Heraclitus’s argument erroneously assumes that the identity of a river is derived from its parts, specifically its water. By focusing exclusively on the parts (water), Heraclitus fails to recognize the structural-functional reciprocity of the river with other nested natural units as the true designation of its identity. A river is an entity because its distinctly propertied nature conditions its actions in relation to other entities as a whole. It's flow properties are relational to its headwaters, tributaries, and downstream sedimentation patterns. A river exhibits ([[Dynamic Invariance\|dynamic invariance]]) natural rhythms, such as seasonal flow variations, that persist regardless of the individual water molecules involved. The flow, sediment load, and ability to erode rock are not "attached" to the river; they are what the river is. Without these properties, the river would cease to be. Because properties are inseparable from entities, they do not have any independent existence. While parts are, for the most part, able to be seperated, replaced, and broken down further. An entity’s properties are what it is, not something external or supplementary. Entities (as nested natural units) are coherent at every scale without subsuming one scale under or into another.

To illustrate further why arbitrary designations fail: a car is an entity as it is distinctly propertied such as to enable mobility, energy conversion, and passenger transport, which depend on the structural-functional repricoity among its parts and a mutually compatable driving-terrain. However, you cannot designate "the steering wheel and the left rear tire" as a separate entity because this grouping is not distinctly propertied such as to enable it to act as a whole. The steering wheel cannot direct movement without the rest of the car's systems, and the tire cannot move independently of the vehicle's integration in relation to the terrain. 

For something to qualify as an entity, *it must be distinctly propertied and act as a unified whole at the scale-relevant context of its causal efficaciousness*. What this implies is that the proper designation of an entity (as a nested natural unit) depends on the right [[Degrees of Freedom\|degrees of freedom]] necessary to describe the system’s behavior:

In the house system some of the relevant degrees of freedom include the division of rooms, access points (doors, windows), and thermal or acoustic insulation. The door is a key degree of freedom, as it regulates access and environmental separations—a door, as a whole, is distinctly propertied such as to enable resistance to environmental factors (like drafts or noise). And the door’s role in separating or connecting rooms within the house is not reducible to its parts either. The knob, while essential at finer grains of analyses, is not functionally relevant at this *level of differentiation*. Zoom in on the door system and the relevant degrees of freedom include the door’s rotation-locking mechanism, and smooth alignment within the frame. The knob directly conditions the rotation-locking mechanism and its operation conditions an agent's mutual compatability or access to the door's functionality in that regard. And zooming out again, the larger human ecosystem the relevant degrees of freedom include the arrangement of shelters, flow of resources, interactions between individuals, and many other socio-environmental factors. Here, the house as a structural-functional unit is an entity of interest at the *level* of human activities—that influence the higher ordered ecosystem and its constraints on these lower ordered systems. The door and knob are nested components in the house’s structural-functional reciprocity. The knob’s properties are distinct from the door’s, but they reciprocally align to support the door’s role within the house system. The house, in turn, is nested within the broader human ecosystem, and its properties, such as insulation and sheltering capacity, enable it to facilitate the distinctly human ways of life. At no level do entities lose their distinctness. A door remains a door, even as it influences and aligns to the constraints of higher ordered system like the house. Similarly, a river remains a river, even as it flows into the ocean and participates in global hydrological cycles. The nested nature of these systems highlights the principle that: *entities are defined by their structural-functional reciprocity with other nested natural units*. Not by reductionist or arbitrary designation.

[^1]: I use the phrasing "**distinctly propertied**" rather than "has identity" or "has properties" to avoid any implication that identity or properties are separable from the entity itself, as though they were external or supplemental attributes layered onto an otherwise inert substrate. To say an entity _has_ identity risks invoking a dualistic view, where identity is treated as an addition to or abstraction from the entity, rather than being what the entity _is_ (viz., [[Existence is Identity\|"existence is identity"]]). This distinction is crucial for avoiding [[Metaphysics\|metaphysical]] errors like those underpinning [the ontological argument for God](https://www.youtube.com/live/hpQvLUCsni4?si=Srad202F4jLgmPlE), which falsely assumes that properties can exist independently of entities—as though they could subsist in abstraction and compel the existence of a corresponding entity. In reality, properties are neither Platonic forms nor independent forces that "cofer" identity upon an entity; they are inherent ([[inherent vs intrinsic\|as opposed to "intrinsic"]]—a term laden with its own mystic connotations) to an entity’s structural-functional reciprocity within the nested natural systems of reality. An entity’s properties are not bestowed, added, or emergent; they simply are what the entity _is_—its systemicity and relationality as a cohesive whole. To avoid mysticism, as well as both reductionism and emergentism ([[Reductionist Fallacies\|two sides of the same coin]]), it is essential to recognize that action belongs exclusively to entities, not to properties. Properties do not "emerge," "arise," or "act." Instead, they condition how an entity acts, both as cause and result from the entity’s reciprocal alignment with other nested natural units. The notion that "existence is a property," central to Anselm’s argument, fails to grasp that existence is not an additive characteristic but *the* fundamental fact of reality. In fact *nothing is fundamental with respect to anything else*. Rather: *everything is fundamental*. Things differ from one another only in terms of [[Energy-Symmetry Reciprocity\|their symmetry characteristics]]. To speak of a "perfect" being whose properties compel its existence distorts the nature of reality, reducing the coherence of properties, entities, and existence itself to a [[Floating Abstraction\|floating abstraction]]—"condensing fog into thicker fog" as [[Ayn Rand\|Rand]] would put it. The phrasing that an entity is "distinctly propertied" captures the unity of an entity and its properties—contextually grounded in reality itself, [[Dynamic Differentiated-Holism\|as a diverse and unified whole]].

[^2]: The dynamical properties of water (Referencing: [Nuclear Quantum Effects in Water and Aqueous Systems: Experiment, Theory, and Current Challenges](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1duTwcT6yP7neDPhXBYxtKGLw8pIY4max/view?usp=sharing)) adapt in remarkable ways to maintain its structural-functional coherence under constrained conditions. The role of the potential energy surface is crucial here, as it governs the quantum interactions and energy distributions of the water system. For instance, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) significantly influence hydrogen bond dynamics by altering proton behavior. When water molecules are confined or brought into close proximity—such as on specific solid surfaces or under high-pressure conditions—shortened oxygen-oxygen (O-O) distances result in enhanced quantum delocalization of protons. These delocalized protons, facilitated by quantum tunneling, form new spatial relationships, allowing water to reorganize its molecular structure while maintaining its cohesive identity and functional properties. This dynamic adaptability, governed by the constraints of the potential energy surface, demonstrates water's capacity as an entity to exhibit a structural-functional reciprocity in varied embedded contexts.
